Activate the Project Virtual Environment (when you work on the project)
Once the project virtual environment exists, we activate the virtual environment to work on the project - or when we open a new terminal.

On Windows:

.venv\Scripts\Activate

you should be able to open your project folder (cintel-04-local) in VS Code. Open a terminal and activate the project (anytime you open a new terminal) and run the shiny app.
shiny run --reload --launch-browser penguins/app.py
